[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to this project are very welcome! They are most likely to be merged in if they hew to this project's basic goals, scope and structure:

* If accepted, your pull-requests will be released to the world under the same license as the rest of the code: the MIT license.
* It's probably best to [log an issue](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/new) to report a bug or ask how something is meant to be done before jumping in and modifying the code, if only to confirm that there isn't another way to do what you're aiming for :)
* When reporting an issue, please try to provide a replicable test case so that others can help you.
* Multiple small pull requests which aim to solve clearly-stated problems are preferable to large pull requests which make many unrelated changes
* The code for this project is written in CoffeeScript and thereafter compiled to Javascript, so it would be best to submit modifications to the CoffeeScript source files rather than to the automatically-generated Javascript source files (please reach out if you've made some neat modifications to the Javascript and want help 'porting' back up to the CoffeeScript version). The easy way to work with this is to leave a `coffee -w -o dist -c *coffee` command running in a terminal, which auto-compiles from CoffeeScript into the `dist` directory as you make changes so that the examples in the `examples` directory will work.
* The aim of this project is to have an extensible core component that fits into a single smallish file ([pivot.coffee](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee)), which depends only on the jQuery and jQueryUI core. If you want to submit changes which depend on other libraries, please submit them as separate 'plugin' files like the Google Chart or D3 renderers.
* This is a cross-browser, client-side library with very little (if any) browser-specific shim code, so please try to submit modifications that work with as many browsers as possible and which don't require any server-side components
